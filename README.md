# Maze

This application is a simple NxN perfect maze that uses the backtracker algorithm that I found on the Internet.  I wrote it back in 2007 so my son, who was 3 at the time, had something to keep him busy.

I coded it in Swing because I used to be a Swing developer for AT&T way back in the late 90s and for IBM in the early 2000s.  I was a big fan of Swing, at least when it matured.

I added it to GitHub to get some exposure to using Git and GitHub.
